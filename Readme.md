## What is the purpose of this project?

This is a classic game of Hangman developed in Python as a part of my high school project. The game prompts the user to guess a secret word letter by letter. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman's body is drawn, and if the player runs out of attempts and the hangman is complete, the game ends, and the player loses. If the player successfully guesses the word, they win the game.

## Installation

To play this game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website, python.org.

To download this game, you can either clone this repository or download the zip file and extract it on your computer.

## Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the game is located. Then run the following command:

python Final2.py

The game will start, and you can start guessing the letters of the secret word. You can guess a letter by typing it and pressing Enter. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the secret word. If the letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman's body will be drawn. You have a limited number of attempts to guess the word, so make sure to guess wisely.
